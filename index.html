          Catch up with the Trending news around the world
        </h2>
        <p class="title-Text">
          Here we bring you the most relevant and accurate news around the world
          week ago a friend invited a couple of other couples over for dinner.
          Eventually, the food (but not the wine) was cleared off the table for
          what turned out to be some fierce Scrabbling. Heeding the strategy of
          going for the shorter, more valuable word over the longer cheaper
          word, our final play was “Bon,” which–as luck would have it!–happens
          to be a Japanese Buddhist festival, and not, as I had originally
          asserted while laying the tiles on the board, one half of a
          chocolate-covered cherry treat. Anyway, the strategy worked. My team
          only lost by 53 points instead of 58. Just the day before, our host
          had written of the challenges of writing short. In journalism–my
          friend’s chosen trade, and mostly my own, too–Mark Twain’s observation
          undoubtedly applies: “I didn’t have time to write a short letter, so I
          wrote a long one instead.” The principle holds across genres, in
          letters, reporting, and other writing. It’s harder to be concise than
          to blather. (Full disclosure, this blog post will clock in at a
          blather-esque 803 words.) Good writing is boiled down, not baked full
          of air like a souffl??. No matter how yummy souffl??s may be. Which
          they are. Yummy like a Grisham novel.

        <span class="post-date">10th Sept 2023</span>
        <p class="post-description">
          Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients that are responsible for many
          life-sustaining biological processes. While most people can get enough
          from diet alone, others may need to take a supplement. However, to
          ensure safety, they should do so under the guidance of a doctor or
          registered dietitian.Each vitamin and mineral plays a different role
          in bodily processes. For example, sodium and potassium are crucial for
          proper function of the central nervous system. Consuming enough of the
          required vitamins and minerals is an essential part of eating a
          balanced diet. Although a varied diet usually provides the
          micronutrients a person needs, some people with restrictive diets —
          such as vegetarians, people with certain medical conditions, and older
          adults — may need to take a supplement. Read more to learn how much of
          each vitamin and mineral an individual should consume, which
          micronutrients are harmful when a person consumes them in excess, and
          what common deficiencies there are.

        <span class="post-date">12th August 2021</span>
        <p class="post-description">
          OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed creator of ChatGPT, has confirmed the
          chatbot can now browse the internet to provide users with current
          information. The artificial intelligence-powered system was previously
          trained only using data up to September 2021. The move means some
          premium users will be able to ask the chatbot questions about current
          affairs, and access news. OpenAI said the feature would open up to all
          users soon. Earlier in the week, OpenAI also revealed the chatbot will
          soon be able to have voice conversations with users. ChatGPT and other
          similar systems use huge amounts of data to create convincing
          human-like responses to user queries. They are expected to
          dramatically change the way people search for information online.

          The boss of Spotify says he has no plans to completely ban content
          created by artificial intelligence from the music streaming platform.
          Earlier this year the platform pulled a track featuring AI-cloned
          voices of the performers Drake and The Weeknd. Daniel Ek told the BBC
          there were valid uses of the tech in making music - but AI should not
          be used to impersonate human artists without their consent. He said
          using AI in music was likely to be debated for "many, many years".Mr
          Ek, who rarely speaks to the media, said that he saw three "buckets"
          of AI use: tools such as auto-tune which improve music, which he

            Rural Food Habits</span

        >
        <p class="post-description">
          Shyamal Santra, Associate Director for Public Health and Nutrition,
          Transform Rural India shares the changing food patterns of rural
          India.On a recent journey to Kurdeg block in Jharkhand, I was
          travelling with a young boy from Simdega who was returning from
          college. While on the tempo van, it came to a halt at a location so
          passengers could fill up on water from a tap. During this break, the
          boy reached out for a packet of Kurkure because he was hungry. Many
          other passengers did the same. When asked about food options, he
          shared that along his route, no restaurants are serving traditional
          meals like Roti and Sabji. He also mentioned that such options are
          expensive and time-consuming. He suggested that it’s more convenient
          to snack on items like Kurkure or chips with a bottle of water,
          reserving the main meal for home. This practice is quite common among
          children and youngsters, even in villages.For the longest time,
          malnutrition has been a major concern in rural India while the issues
          around obesity have been sidelined. However, the significant rise in
          obesity levels among rural children and adults is a growing problem
          and needs urgent attention. Especially with the rising prevalence of
          non-communicable diseases in rural India and the related health risks
          associated with obesity, it requires immediate public attention.

          Khalistani Bhaggu Brar intelligence reports reveal extensive Pakistani
          links to pro-Khalistani terror activities, implicating individuals in
          Canada.The series of reports on the dossier put up by the Indian
          intelligence on pro-Khalistani terror activities from Canada has also
          exposed the extensive Pakistani link. Be it Arsh Dala, Parry Dulai,
          Gurjinder Singh Pannu, or Gurjeet Singh Cheema – all have either been
          closely associated with or, at some point in time, took help from
          Lakhbir Singh Rode, a Pakistan-based Khalistani separatist who
          currently heads the proscribed terror outfit International Sikh Youth
          Federation (ISYF), for their terror activities from Canadian soil.
          While Arsh Dala has been closely associated with Rode, Parry Dulai and
          Cheema allegedly played a role in sourcing a weapon consignment from
          across the border in May 2017 for ISYF module members with the help of
          the Pak-based terrorist.
